This example shows how to integrate an existing NodeKit or Node.

The example has been taken from the Coin documentation of SoBaseKit that
you will find here: http://doc.coin3d.org/Coin/classSoBaseKit.html

Simply generate a swig interface file like I did for the ShapeScale
nodekit.  The first line tells swig about the module name; in our case:

%module shapescale

then add a %{...%} section where you include all headers of your NodeKits
that you want to provide in your module. They are needed for compilation.

Now include the 'pivy_common_typemaps.i' interface file that contain
typemaps that are needed and common for all pivy modules.

%include pivy_common_typemaps.i

Finally add all the headers (of your Nodekits) that swig should actually
parse, hence the "%include ShapeScale.h" directive at the end.

Look at the SConstruct file for information in how to build the module.

If everything is build just import the freshly generated module like
e.g. so:

>>> from shapescale import *
