Pivy follows the same source code guidelines as Coin[1] for C/C++.

Although it's not that a big deal as with C/C++ code, Python code
should still follow PEP8[2]. Python docstrings should adhere to
PEP257[3].

Please, read these documents thoroughly; esp. the section "Coin Code
Standards" in the Coin HACKING manifesto! Try to adhere to those
guidelines as much as possible; be it only for consistency reasons.
